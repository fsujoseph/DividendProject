# Dividend Project
## Program Description

This is a nifty tool I created once I developed an interest in the stock market. It uses the Beautiful Soup package to scrape the live stock price data from RobinHood, and then it scrapes the companies historical dividend payout to estimate your yearly dividend totals. The program prompts the user to enter their stock holdings and quantities and then saves it so it can easily be revisited without having to re-enter it every time.

## Executing Program

To run the script, download the .py file and run the file with the command line or your IDE of choice. The command line will prompt you to follow the instructions to use the program.

## Future Improvements

I am planning on adding a GUI so that it is a bit more accessible, but it still functions well as it currently is. It's the first project I did on my own, and I was proud to make a tool that is useful and represents a clear time improvement over hand calculations.
