To run the project make sure you have the following installed:
1. Beautiful Soup
2. Requests
3. Json
4. lxml
5. OS

If using PyCharm all of these can be easily installed as packages. Once you do that the imports in the script will take care of everything.
Note: OS comes with Python and doesn't have to be installed as a package.


This video will help install Beautiful Soup and Requests if not using PyCharm.
